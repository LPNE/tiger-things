  <p>The world has lost 97% of its tiger population in a little over a century. Three tiger subspecies, the Bali, Javan and Caspian tigers, became extinct in the 1980s. An accurate count of how many tigers are left in the world is uncertain but, one thing’s for sure, the numbers are alarmingly low.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>About 50% of wild Bengal tigers in the world roam the national parks of India. The Bengal tiger is a subspecies native to the Indian subcontinent. Wild tigers are becoming increasingly difficult to spot in India, although, if you’re lucky, there’s a chance of seeing one while on a tiger safari in Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan.</p>

  <p>Chinese culture has mythologized the powers of the tiger and tiger parts have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 1000 years. Almost every part of the tiger is used for a medicinal cure. Tiger claws are a sedative for insomnia while teeth are used to treat fever. Tiger bone is believed to be an anti-inflammatory and used to treat rheumatism and arthritis. The unfortunate part about this is most of these ailments can be treated with over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, or natural remedies. Even so, the demand for tiger parts for use in traditional medicine continues to fuel tiger poaching.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There are an estimated 3200 tigers left in the wild.</li><br><br><br>
    <li>According to WWF there are more tigers (between 5000 and 7000 tigers) living in captivity in the USA than in the wild.</li><br><br><br>
    <li>In the USA, there are no federal laws regulating the possession of exotic animals. You can buy a tiger online (a five-month-old tiger cub costs around US $14,000). In Australia, exotic animals (such as monkeys, lions and tigers) can’t be kept as pets by private owners.</li><br><br><br>
    <li>India has the largest population of wild tigers.</li>
